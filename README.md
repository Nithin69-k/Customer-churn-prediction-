## 📌 Introduction
Customer churn refers to when subscribers stop using a company’s services and switch to competitors.  
In the telecom industry, churn rates can be as high as **15–25% annually** due to intense competition.  

- Retaining existing customers is **more cost-effective** than acquiring new ones.  
- Machine Learning helps by **identifying at-risk customers early**, allowing targeted retention strategies.  
- This project uses ML models to predict churn and highlight factors influencing customer decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Calculate the **% of churn vs retained customers**.  
- Analyze **key drivers** responsible for churn.  
- Train ML models to classify **churn vs non-churn customers**.  
- Recommend the **best-performing model** for real-world deployment.
